You walk into the town square. There is an blacksmith selling weapons and armor (not that
a humble pig farmer like you would have any use for such tools), a grocer, a pub, and a
butcher. "Hello nameValue!" calls the butcher. "Do
You have some pork for me today?"

1. "Yes butcher!" (go into the shop to sell pork)
